1. **Small Pull Requests (PRs)**:  
   - Limit PRs to **≤400 lines of code (LOC)** to maximize defect detection rates .  
   - Break large features into **stacked PRs** (e.g., frontend, API, database) for parallel reviews .  
2. **Automated Pre-Checks**:  
   - Mandate pre-commit hooks for linting, unit tests, and static analysis (SAST) to catch style/security issues early .  
   - Use secrets scanners to prevent hardcoded credentials .  
3. **Context Documentation**:  
   - Include a **PR summary** explaining the *what*, *why*, and *risks* of changes .  
   - Annotate complex logic to guide reviewers .  

#### **Phase 2: Review Execution**  
1. **Reviewer Selection**:  
   - Assign **two reviewers**: one domain expert (e.g., backend) and one senior engineer for architectural oversight .  
2. **Time-Boxed Reviews**:  
   - Limit sessions to **≤60 minutes** to maintain focus .  
   - Prioritize feedback on critical areas: security, performance, and compliance .  
3. **Checklist-Driven Feedback**:  
   - Use a standardized checklist covering:  
     - **Functionality**: Edge cases, error handling .  
     - **Security**: Input validation, encryption, access controls .  
     - **Maintainability**: Modularity, documentation .  

#### **Phase 3: Post-Review**  
1. **Approval & Merge**:  
   - Require **two approvals** for high-risk changes (e.g., payment processing) .  
   - Automatically rerun tests post-merge to prevent regressions .  
2. **Feedback Culture**:  
   - Frame suggestions as questions (e.g., “Could we optimize this query?”) to foster collaboration .  
   - Acknowledge well-written code to reinforce positive practices .  

#### **Phase 4: Continuous Improvement**  
1. **Metrics Tracking**:  
   - Monitor **defect density**, **review coverage**, and **time-to-approval** to identify bottlenecks .  
   - Conduct quarterly retrospectives to refine guidelines .

### **Data Science Project Quality Control Guidelines**  
*(For Modern Banks & Regulated Industries)*  

Ensuring high-quality data science (DS) projects requires **rigorous validation, reproducibility, fairness, and compliance checks**. Below is a **detailed checklist** covering the entire DS pipeline—from data ingestion to model deployment.  

---

## **1. Data Quality Control**  
**Objective:** Ensure data is **accurate, unbiased, and representative** of real-world scenarios.  

### **Guidelines:**  
✅ **Source Validation**  
- Verify data sources (e.g., transactional databases, APIs, third-party vendors).  
- Document **provenance** (who collected it, when, and how).  

✅ **Missing & Invalid Data Handling**  
- Explicitly handle missing values (imputation, flagging, or removal with justification).  
- Detect and correct **outliers** (use domain-specific thresholds).  

✅ **Bias & Fairness Assessment**  
- Check for **demographic skews** (e.g., gender/age imbalance in loan applications).  
- Use fairness metrics (**disparate impact ratio, equalized odds**).  

✅ **Data Leakage Prevention**  
- Ensure no **future data** leaks into training (critical for time-series forecasting).  
- Validate **train-test splits** (stratified sampling for imbalanced datasets).  

---

## **2. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**  
**Objective:** Ensure features are **meaningful, reproducible, and unbiased**.  

### **Guidelines:**  
✅ **Feature Documentation**  
- Maintain a **data dictionary** (description, source, transformation logic).  
- Example:  
  - **Feature**: `credit_utilization_ratio`  
  - **Definition**: `(total_credit_used / total_credit_limit) * 100`  
  - **Source**: `transactions_db.credit_cards`  

✅ **Reproducibility**  
- Save **preprocessing steps** (e.g., Scikit-Learn pipelines, `.pkl` files).  
- Avoid **hardcoded thresholds** (use config files instead).  

✅ **Feature Importance Validation**  
- Compare **SHAP/LIME explanations** with domain knowledge.  
- Flag **nonsensical correlations** (e.g., "account_number predicts fraud").  

---

## **3. Model Development & Validation**  
**Objective:** Ensure models are **accurate, fair, and interpretable**.  

### **Guidelines:**  
✅ **Baseline Comparison**  
- Always compare against a **simple benchmark** (e.g., logistic regression, rule-based model).  

✅ **Performance Metrics**  
- Choose metrics aligned with **business impact**:  
  - **Fraud Detection**: Precision/Recall (minimize false negatives).  
  - **Credit Scoring**: AUC-ROC + Fairness metrics.  

✅ **Cross-Validation Strategy**  
- Use **time-based splits** for financial data (no shuffling!).  
- Ensure **stratified sampling** for imbalanced classes.  

✅ **Interpretability & Explainability**  
- For high-stakes models (e.g., loan approvals), use:  
  - **SHAP/LIME** for local explanations.  
  - **Global feature importance** (permutation tests).  

✅ **Bias Mitigation**  
- Apply techniques like:  
  - **Reweighting** (adjust class weights).  
  - **Adversarial Debiasing** (for fairness-aware models).  

---

## **4. Code & Implementation Quality**  
**Objective:** Ensure **clean, maintainable, and production-ready code**.  

### **Guidelines:**  
✅ **Modularity**  
- Separate logic into **functions/classes** (e.g., `data_loader.py`, `train_model.py`).  
- Avoid **Jupyter notebooks in production** (convert to `.py` scripts).  

✅ **Testing**  
- Unit tests for **critical functions** (e.g., feature engineering, metrics).  
- Test **edge cases** (e.g., empty DataFrames, NaN inputs).  

✅ **Reproducibility**  
- **Pin dependencies** (`requirements.txt`, `conda env export`).  
- Use **MLflow/DVC** to track experiments.  

✅ **Logging & Debugging**  
- Log **model predictions + inputs** for auditing.  
- Use **debug flags** (`verbose=True` for development).  

---

## **5. Deployment & Monitoring**  
**Objective:** Ensure models **work reliably in production**.  

### **Guidelines:**  
✅ **Model Packaging**  
- Containerize with **Docker** for consistency.  
- Use **ONNX/TensorRT** for optimized inference.  

✅ **Input/Output Validation**  
- Enforce **schema checks** (e.g., `pydantic`, `Great Expectations`).  
- Example:  
  ```python
  class LoanRequest(BaseModel):
      income: float = Field(..., gt=0)
      credit_score: int = Field(..., ge=300, le=850)
  ```

✅ **Performance & Scalability**  
- Load-test with **synthetic traffic** (e.g., Locust, k6).  
- Monitor **latency + error rates** (Prometheus/Grafana).  

✅ **Drift Detection**  
- Track:  
  - **Data drift** (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).  
  - **Concept drift** (accuracy decay over time).  
- Set **auto-retrain triggers** (e.g., "if drift > 10%").  

---

## **6. Compliance & Documentation**  
**Objective:** Meet **regulatory (GDPR, FCRA) and audit requirements**.  

### **Guidelines:**  
✅ **Model Cards**  
- Document:  
  - **Intended use & limitations**.  
  - **Fairness evaluation results**.  
  - **Training data demographics**.  

✅ **Audit Trails**  
- Log **all predictions + inputs** (for dispute resolution).  
- Store **model versions + training data hashes**.  

✅ **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**  
- For high-risk decisions (e.g., loan denials), require **manual review**.
