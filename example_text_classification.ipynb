      "LLM thinking: I applied the thinking styles to the seed task instruction by considering multiple viewpoints, analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available. I also thought about the potential biases or flaws in thinking and how they could impact the performance of the agent. Additionally, I considered the time sensitivity of the problem, and although classifying a product is generally not time-sensitive, it's essential to make decisions quickly in a real-world scenario. Furthermore, I thought about how to measure progress on this problem, and I realize that progress can be measured by the accuracy of the classifications. Finally, I attempted to apply creative thinking by generating innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem, thinking beyond traditional boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality. By mixing these thinking styles, I was able to create mutated instructions that keep similar semantic meaning as the original seed task instruction and are able to accomplish the task described in the task description.\n",
